Response times are a crucial component of understanding and measuring cognitive processes. But, {\color{blue}  how do we know that the parameters we are estimating from a response time distribution are representative of the true population parameters?} One beautiful solution: A parameter recovery study.

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/ParameterRecovery.jpg}
  \end{center}

This study focused on classical maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE), an estimation method that compares the relative likelihoods of parameter probabilities. But what does it mean to compare likelihoods of parameter probabilities?

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/ProbVSLike.jpg}
  \end{center}

CMLE was tested on a specific model of response times, known as the shifted-Wald model. The shifted-Wald model is composed of three parameters: shift, drift rate, and response threshold.

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/sWaldModel.jpg}
  \end{center}

By completing a parameter recovery study, we can gauge how well CMLE can estimate these parameters from a shifted-Wald model.

\headerbox{Method}{name=method, span=1, below=background, above=bottom}{

For this study, we simulated data using the parameters reported by Faulkenberry et al. (2018). This was composed of four main steps:

  \begin{itemize} \compresslist
  \item Generate 'artificial' people from parent population
  \item Generate response times for artifical people
  \item Fit shifted-Wald model to RT distribution with CMLE
  \item Compare estimates to original parameters
  \end{itemize}

This process was applied to 5 sub-experiments in a design used by Farrell and Ludwig (2008). These sub-experiments had 5, 20, or 80 participants, with 20, 80, or 500 trials per particpant.

  \item How do other tools compare to CMLE in shifted-Wald models?

  \item How can we use this information about participant versus trial size to make informed decisions?
